      "body": "ISLAMABAD: In order to avert the bloodshed and looming collision between the marchers and the law enforcers in Islamabad, the PTI on Monday moved the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for staging a sit-in and jalsa in the capital.\nThe petition, filed by PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan, says that the party has held several public rallies, seminars, corner meetings, public gatherings, and conventions in the past. It stated that PTI is a peaceful party and does not believe in confrontation with state institutions.\nIt has, therefore, sought the court's permission to gather the marchers in the capital city and hold a sit-in at the Sri Nagar Highway between H-9 and G-9 area and near the Weekly Bazar \u2014 which falls under the deputy commissioner's administrative control \u2014 following the Supreme Court of Pakistan's decision.\nThe petition added that the PTI was not granted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) by the DC, despite having written a letter on October 26 deeming the delay \"malafide\". The party, in its petition to the IHC, mentioned that it contacted the DC again on October 28, but was refused permission citing the act as a \"sheer attempt to usurp, hamper and infringe the fundamental rights of freedom of assembly, association, and speech\".\nThe party has named the federal government and the interior ministry for violating the constitutional rights of PTI at the behest of DC Islamabad. The Islamabad Capital Territory Police has also been named as one of the respondents in the petition.\nThe PTI has, therefore, approached the court assuring to abide by the law and constitution during its long march in the federal capital and has sought the protection of the party's fundamental rights.\u00a0\n",

      "body": "PERTH: Pakistan's bowlers, led by spinner Shadab Khan, helped them hammer the Netherlands by six wickets in Perth on Sunday for a first win at the Twenty20 World Cup which kept their faint hopes of reaching the semi-finals alive.\nPakistan restricted the Dutch to 91-9, and then cruised to 95-4 with 37 balls to spare as Mohammad Rizwan made 49.\nBut it was the bowlers set up victory for a side that lost their opener to India and then were shocked by Zimbabwe in Group 2.\nShadab returned figures of 3-22 and pace bowler Mohammad Wasim took two wickets to set the tone for their team's domination against a Dutch side who are out of the semi-final running after losing a third straight Super 12 match.\n\"Very happy. Performed very well in the bowling and in the batting,\" Pakistan captain Babar Azam said after the team's first ever T20 victory in Australia.\n\"In my opinion we could chase better than this. But a win always gives you confidence. We'll try to do our best in the next matches and win.\"\nPakistan lost Azam, for four, in the second over of their chase when he was run out by a direct throw from Roelof van der Merwe.\nBut Rizwan attacked from the start, hitting five fours and putting on 37 with the returning Fakhar Zaman.\nFast bowler Brandon Glover had Zaman caught behind for 20 as a crowd of over 10,000, dominated by Pakistan supporters, feared for the worst at a venue where Pakistan fell short by one run in their chase of a modest 130 against Zimbabwe on Thursday.\nBut Rizwan and Shan Masood calmed the nerves with stand of 30 and, despite both falling near the end, Pakistan sailed past their target as bowling hero Shadab hit the winning four.\nNetherlands captain Scott Edwards won the toss and chose to bat first but Pakistan's new-ball bowlers kept a disciplined line and only three runs came from the first two overs.\nReturning opener Stephan Myburgh broke the shackles with a boundary off Shaheen Shah Afridi only to fall next ball, caught at fine leg attempting another big hit to be out for six.\nThere was no respite from the Pakistan quick bowlers.\nWasim took two wickets in two balls only for Paul van Meekeren to survive the hat-trick delivery, and Haris Rauf made good use of the bounce on offer.\nA nasty bouncer from Rauf got through Bas de Leede's helmet grill, forcing the batsman off the ground with a bruised cheek bone.\nHe returned from a medical check to sit out the rest of the match in the dugout sporting a nasty-looking black eye.\nShadab's leg spin had Tom Cooper caught for one after the power play and then trapped Max O' Dowd lbw for eight in his next over.\n\"I have bowled against few of their players in county cricket, so I know how they play,\" said Shadab.\n\"All our bowlers bowled well. The fast bowlers put pressure in the powerplay, and I took wickets because of the pressure that built.\"\nAfter crawling to 34-3 after 10 overs, and with De Leede retired hurt, Netherlands captain Edwards and Colin Ackermann (27) attempted to rebuild with a 35-run stand but once they were separated the wickets kept tumbling.\nShadab trapped Ackermann lbw and Edwards fell soon after, for 15, to Naseem Shah.\nVan Meekeren was last to go run out off the final ball for seven.\nPakistan need to win their remaining matches against South Africa on Thursday and Bangladesh in a week's time and need other results to go their way to have any chance of securing a semi-final place.\n",

It put South Africa top of Group 2 on five points, one ahead of India and Bangladesh.\nSouth Africa's Lungi Ngidi led a fiery pace onslaught to keep India to 133-9 at the Twenty20 World Cup on Sunday, despite an attacking half-century by Suryakumar Yadav.\nIndia won the toss and chose to bat in their bid for a third straight win but the South African quicks made life difficult on a fast and bouncy Perth pitch.\nYadav's 40-ball 68, laced with six fours and three sixes, helped India recover from 49-5.\nNgidi returned figures of 4-29 off his four overs, ably supported by fellow fast bowler Wayne Parnell who finished with 3-15 after starting the innings with a T20 rarity \u2014 a maiden over.\nSkipper Rohit Sharma hit a six and a four before being caught and bowled by Ngidi, who returned to the side as South Africa's only change.\nHe got KL Rahul next for nine but the big wicket came when Ngidi sent back Virat Kohli for 12, caught in the deep, to silence an Indian-dominated crowd.\nUnable to handle the extra bounce on the Perth track, the Indians lost half their side for 49 inside nine overs.\nKagiso Rabada took a stunning catch at long leg to see the back of danger man Hardik Pandya for Ngidi's fourth wicket.\nYadav hit back with a couple of sixes as he rebuilt the innings with Dinesh Karthik.\nThe in-form Yadav, who hit an unbeaten 51 against the Netherlands in their previous win, even smashed Ngidi for a huge six over fine leg to bring alive the fans. He then reached his fifty off 30 balls with another four.\nKarthik tried to join the attack but fell to Parnell, who broke the stand which had been worth 52 and the same bowler finally dismissed Yadav for 68 in the 19th over.\nThe Proteas need 134 runs to win and stay unbeaten in the tournament after a washout in their opening match against Zimbabwe and a big win against Bangladesh.\nIndia: Rohit Sharma (capt), KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Dinesh Karthik, Deepak Hooda, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Arshdeep Singh.\nSouth Africa: Quinton de Kock, Temba Bavuma (capt), Rilee Rossouw, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Tristan Stubbs, Wayne Parnell, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Lungi Ngidi.\n",

      "body": "MORBI: At least 132 people died in India when a colonial-era pedestrian bridge overloaded with religious revellers collapsed into the river below, police said Monday.\nAuthorities said nearly 500 people were celebrating a festival on and around the nearly 150-year-old suspension bridge in Morbi when supporting cables snapped after dark on Sunday.\nThe structure in the western state of Gujarat crashed into the river, spilling scores of people into the water while others clung desperately to the wreckage shouting for help.\n\"I saw the bridge collapse before my eyes,\" one witness who worked all night trying to rescue people said, without giving his name.\n\"It was traumatic when a woman showed me a photo of her daughter and asked if I had rescued her. I could not tell her that her daughter had died.\"\nAnother witness named Supran told local media that the bridge was \"jam-packed\".\n\"The cables snapped and the bridge came down in a split second. People fell on each other and into the river,\" he said.\nRanjanbhai Patel, another Morbi resident, told local media of the difficulties he and other faced in their bid to help people to shore.\n\"We pulled out people who were able to swim ashore. As most of the people had fallen into the river, we were not able to save them,\" he said.\nSenior police official Ashok Kumar Yadav told AFP on Monday morning that the death toll now stood at 132. Sources said that most of the victims were women and children.\nAround 15 others were being treated in hospital.\nThe bridge over the Machchhu river, a popular tourist spot, had only reopened several days earlier after months of repairs.\nNews reports showed footage of people clambering up the twisted remains of the bridge or trying to swim to safety in the dark.\nP. Dekavadiya, the head of police in Morbi, earlier told AFP by phone that more that 130 people had been rescued.\nThe suspension bridge, 233 metres (764 feet) long and 1.5 metres wide, was inaugurated in 1880 by the British colonial authorities and made with materials shipped from England, reports said.\nBroadcaster NDTV reported that it reopened on Wednesday after seven months of repairs despite not having a safety certificate, and that video footage from Saturday showed it swaying wildly.\nDistrict police have launched an enquiry against the contractor, Yadav said. The state has set up a five-member team to probe the tragedy.\nAuthorities quickly launched a rescue operation following the collapse, with boats and divers deployed to search for missing people.\nDozens of soldiers and sailors from the Indian Army and Navy were also called in for the rescue operation.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who was touring his home state of Gujarat at the time, announced compensation for those killed and injured in the accident.\nThe Gujarat government on its website describes the bridge some 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of the state's main city, Ahmedabad, as \"an engineering marvel\".\nAccidents from old and poorly maintained infrastructure including bridges are common in India.\nIn 2016 the collapse of a flyover onto a busy street in the eastern city of Kolkata killed at least 26 people.\nIn 2011 at least 32 people were killed when a bridge packed with festival crowds collapsed near the hill town of Darjeeling in India's northeast.\nLess than a week later around 30 people were killed when a footbridge over a river in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh collapsed.\n",

      "body": "AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine has been linked to a 30-percent higher risk of getting a very rare blood clotting condition compared to the Pfizer jab, a large international study said Thursday.\nSeveral countries have already altered their advice after previous research indicated that -- in a tiny number of cases -- thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) can be a possible side effect of Covid vaccines that use an adenovirus vector, or \"engineered\" virus, such as those from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.\nThrombocytopenia produces potentially life-threatening blood clots with low levels of blood platelets -- the small cell fragments in our blood that prevent bleeding.\nThe new study, published in the journal BMJ, was the first to compare thrombocytopenia rates between adenovirus and mRNA vaccines -- such as Pfizer -- across multiple countries.\nThe international research team analysed health data from more than 10 million adults in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States who received at least one vaccine dose between December 2020 and mid-2021.\nIn Germany and the UK, they matched the data of 1.3 million people who had a first dose of AstraZeneca to 2.1 million who took Pfizer.\nThere were a total of 862 \"thrombocytopenia events\" recorded in the 28 days after a first dose of AstraZeneca, compared to 520 for Pfizer, the study said.\nThat meant AstraZeneca's vaccine had a 30-percent higher risk of thrombocytopenia than Pfizer.\nHowever when it came to a second dose, there was no additional risk between any of the vaccines.\nThe study was observational, meaning it could not show cause and effect. But the researchers said that additional analysis found the results to be consistent.\nWhile very rare, these risks \"should be considered when planning further immunisation campaigns and future vaccine development,\" the study said.\nSarah Pitt, a microbiologist at the UK's Brighton University who was not involved in the research, said the \"well-designed\" study \"adds to the data showing that all vaccines are safe and effective\".\nThe \"extremely rare\" cases of thrombocytopenia occurred after just 0.04 percent of vaccine doses in Germany and the UK, she told AFP.\nMost countries had already been avoiding using adenovirus Covid vaccines for the older and young age groups who are more at risk, she added.\nEuropean countries have largely pivoted towards mRNA vaccines. AstraZeneca's jab was never authorised in the US, which limited the use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 jab to certain individuals earlier this year\nHowever both AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines play a pivotal role in Covax global vaccine distribution scheme, which provides doses to lower-income countries.\n",

      "body": "Studies show that smarter people are happier when they are alone, unlike most of people who are happier with friends and family.\nA 2016 study led by\u00a0Norman P. Li and Satoshi Kanazawa investigated the \"savanna theory\" of happiness.\nThe theory suggested that even in the present day, despite many advances, humans respond to situations the same way their ancestors would. The theory is also called the \"evolutionary legacy hypothesis\". The term Savanna refers to the time when mankind lived on the savanna.\nThe study extracted data from 15,197 interviews conducted by the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The sample was aged 18-28.\nThe findings of the study showed that people who lived in areas with greater population density had lower life satisfaction. Authors suggested that this was consistent with the feelings of our ancestors who would have felt threatened and uncomfortable in larger groups.\u00a0\nCiting several other studies, the authors said that the human brain evolved to function in groups of 150 people on average.\nThe study also found that the negative impact of groups and crowds was more on those with average intelligence. Since smarter ancestors had greater strategic flexibility, they were able to adapt well to bigger groups. Therefore, their descendants are also less affected by urban environments.\nThe reason that most people are more satisfied and happier when with people is because of the needs that friends fulfil such as the need to be needed, reliability and the feeling of relatedness.\u00a0\nPeople that are highly intelligent, however, are happier when on their own. Scientists still do not understand the exact reason why this happens. Do intelligent people have different needs? Are other people distracting to them?\nOn the contrary, studies have also shown that spending more time with people and socialising could be an indicator of higher intelligence. The contradiction of the findings has baffled experts.\n",
